# Enemene âœ¨


## Introduction
Enemene is a highly opinionated framework to quickly develop a classic REST API. It is based on Node.JS and Express and uses Sequelize
 for database connections.
 The term "Enemene" is a very stupid idea, but I like it. It comes from the german audio play "Bibi Blocksberg" for children. Bibi is a
  child witch who helps herself or others with the help of spells, and these spells always follow the format "Enemene `something`, `some
   other thing rhyming with something`. Hex Hex!", e.g. "Enemene Maus, Lampe gehe aus. Hex Hex!" ('Enemene mouse, lamp go out!"). As you
    see, **enemene** is the magic word here. That's why its used for the CLI in this framework.
    
## Installation
````
npm install enemene
````

## First configuration 
````
Enemene.create(config)              // Create new server
.then(server => {
    server.setup(routers, views)    // Inject all routers and views to the server
        .then(() => {
            server.start();         // Start the server
    });
});
````

## Concepts

### Entities
Entities are the definition of models. You can create them by executing `enemene mentity` on the command line.

### Views
Views are an abstraction of entities to define the access to them without writing any imperative code. A view is defined with an entity 
 to base on. To limit the access granted by this view to a subset of fields, these can be defined in the view by their name or (with
  complex fields like references or collections) with a sub-view. Only the fields defined in the view will be included in GET responses
   and available for setting in PUT/POST requests.
   Additionally, you can limit the objects accessible by the view by providing a filter (see "Filters").
You can create a rudimentary view by executing `enemene miew` on the command line.

### Routes
If a simple data access layer does not suffice, you can define custom router modules that provide custom routes. Here is an example:
````
@RouterModule("example")
export class ExampleRouter {

    @Get("/:id")
    async getStuff(@Path("id") id: string, 
                   @CurrentUser user: User): Promise<string> {
        // ...
        return id;
    }
}
````
You can inject parameters into every route handler function. See the reference (TBD) for more info on what can be injected.

### Filters
Filters can be defined and used for views or in custom route handlers. Define a filter by using `Filter`:
````
Filter.and(
    Filter.equals("firstName", "Anton")
    Filter.not(
        Filter.exists("role", 
            Filter.equals("name", "Developer")
        )
    )
)
// = Find all where firstName is "Anton" and the role is not the one called "Developer". 
````
